During my time at Nimble Giant Entertainment, I was put in charge of forming a new and original title for the studio that was to be a somewhat horror-based title with sim elements. Due to its currently unannounced nature, I cannot openly disclose many details about the project itself, so I will rather mention what tasks I had taken on at that period in time.
## Principal Game Design

Heading the design and writing all principal game design documents, as well as forming the main gameplay pillars and core values of the initial concept. Most of this was exploratory work for the design, finding what would be more compelling for players to interact while also permitting ease of content generation for the game through development. Paper prototypes and “theatre of the mind” were employed heavily at this stage just to see what was worth pursuing.
## Team Leadership

Working with and communicating goals to Concept Artists and the Lead Art Director, exploring and building on the setting we were creating. As well, conveying the design goals of the title to other designers and ensuring all documentation was maintained and organized appropriately.
## Narrative Design

Organizing the input from many team members into a cohesive story, and building the world around it to serve the themes and tone. Building the core for characters and events while forming a “narrative bible” for the project to guide further progress. Additionally, much time was spent ensuring the narrative appropriately served the gameplay, rather than the other way around.
