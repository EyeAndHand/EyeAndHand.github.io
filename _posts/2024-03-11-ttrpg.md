A personal project of mine, loosely based on 1700s European history with heavy splashes of horror and mysticism. Player characters have no strictly defined archetypes (such as classes, or professions) and instead are defined by their levels of "knowledge" in difference categories. Skill levels are tied to Knowledge, as well as "Talents" (which function more akin to magic spells in fantasy TTRPGs in their more specific use cases).

Notable points include:

- An injury system, that allows players to suffer bodily damage that must be treated outside of combat.
- Sanity mechanics and various manias player characters may suffer.
- Discourse, an abstraction of conversation between two parties.
