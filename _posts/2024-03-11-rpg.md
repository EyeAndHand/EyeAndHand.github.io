A turn-based RPG title set in a rather bizarre setting that I had worked on at a mid-sized indie studio. Working with a small team naturally lends itself to wearing many hats, and I had to flex into several positions as team sizes fluxuated throughout development. Unfortunately, the project was cancelled due to the economic strain on the studio during the COVID-19 quarantines.
## AI Design

In the early stages of designing the enemy AI it was decided to make it purely deterministic, both to punish inattentive players and to give more reaction to players making engaged tactical decisions. Much of my work was based around structuring a system that was entirely deterministic, able to intelligently (and unintelligently) react to the current game state, and be easily modified to characterize the enemy for the player.
## Combat Design

Concurrent with enemy AI, the combat system itself needed to be made more engaging to escape from the overly simplistic strategies in turn-based RPG combat. We settled on a “rock-paper-scissors” system where the player (and the enemy) would be punished for making careless strategic positions. This allowed for new tactical decisions, such as trying to set up “catch-22” situations for the opponent or deal with them as the player, while not requiring much scope.
## Narrative Design

The flow of several areas in the game were my responsibility, as well quite a bit of idle chatter from NPCs. Writing for role-playing games is often a balancing act of trying to flesh out the world and immerse the player, while simultaneously not overloading them with dialogue and bringing down the pace of the game. I had found that careful placement of levity or humour helped ease the burden of too much "lore" dialogue, and allowed for a sort of "tone reset" after dialogue that may be a bit heavy or dramatic.
